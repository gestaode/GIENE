Hello Replit Team,

I am currently working on a complex application that involves multiple features, including content generation, data processing, automation of sales processes, and social media integration. However, I have been facing issues due to frequent errors when trying to generate videos and limitations in processing power.

To optimize the process and ensure better system stability, I would like to divide the application into separate, independent modules. The goal is to isolate non-interlinked functions and create standalone apps/modules, enabling more efficient control over each system area. This would allow me to handle errors, monitor performance, and maintain each function individually. Each module will have a dedicated interface, making it easier to manage and debug.

The modularization will follow this structure:

Content Generation Module: This module will be responsible for generating automated content and texts. It will utilize multiple APIs and alternative approaches for content creation when needed.

Data Processing Module: This module will handle financial data analysis, metrics, and calculations. It will interact with various external services and databases, with fallbacks in place for failure scenarios.

Sales Automation and Funnel Module: This module will automate lead segmentation, email sending, messaging, and integrate with various payment gateways.

Social Media Integration Module: This module will manage integration with platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and others, allowing fallback mechanisms if direct API connections fail. It will also have access to scraping techniques when needed.

Dashboard and Monitoring Module: A real-time panel to track the performance of sales, funnels, and integrations.

Backup and Resilience Testing Module: This module will conduct automated tests and simulate failures to ensure the system remains resilient under various conditions.

Code Export Module: This module will allow exporting the code of the application in formats like CSV and ZIP, enabling easy backups and code sharing.

By modularizing the app, each function will be handled independently, allowing for easier debugging, optimized performance, and better fault tolerance. The system will also be more flexible, with the ability to incorporate different APIs, databases, and GitHub repositories as needed for each module.

I would like to ask for guidance on how to divide the app within Replit, using a modular architecture to ensure that all components run efficiently. Additionally, I am available to assist in the integration process and help with any further setup or troubleshooting that may be required.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
